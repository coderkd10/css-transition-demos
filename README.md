# CSS Transitions Demos

## Motivation

I wanted to learn about *React Transition Group* which can be used to add animation (e.g when elements are added to or removed from a list).

So I started following [this tutorial](https://dev.to/underdogio/adding-animations-to-your-react-app-with-react-transition-group) so that I learn about it and use it my own apps. The tutorial mentioned that I should have a decent understanding of CSS transitions.  

But I wasn't very familiar which CSS transitions so I decided to follow its [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions). MDN had some demos and so I decided I'll implement them myself, and then play with the parameters to gain a solid understanding. This repo contains my implementation of those demos.

## TODOs

- Also add a `transition-delay`
- Demo detecting start / completion of transition
